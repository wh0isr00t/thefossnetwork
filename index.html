        <h2 class=left>Free</h2>
            <p>We're developing a decentralized software suite that is free to use for anyone with a FOSS ID</p>
        <h2 class=right>Open-Source</h2>
            <p>All of our contracts and anything deployed on the FOSS Network is completely open source, visible to the entire public.</p>
        <h2 class=left>Safe</h2>
            <p>No updates or contracts are deployed without community consensus through utilization of FOSS Cards</p>
        <h2 class=right>FOSS Token</h2>
            <p>FOSS Token is the entrypoint for access to the FOSS Network. Stake FOSS to earn your <strong>FOSS ID</strong>, <strong>FOSS Cards</strong>, and even <strong>FOSS Fuel</strong></p>
        <h2 class=left>FOSS ID</h2>
            <p>FOSS IDs are your all access pass to The Foss Network. After earning your FOSS ID, you're welcome to utilize the ever growing toolset on the FOSS Network, and even vote on whether or not to approve feature updates and rate adjustments.</p>
        <h2 class=right>FOSS Cards</h2>
            <p>Used for governance and development submissions within the FOSS Hub, stake yes or no on updates, voting burns staked FOSS Cards when vote resolves. Submit updates by staking FOSS Cards on your submission, if your submission is declined, half of your staked FOSS Cards are burnt, and no reward is granted; if your submission is accepted, all FOSS is BURNT, earn 1,000 FOSS from the treasury for each FOSS Card burnt.</p>
